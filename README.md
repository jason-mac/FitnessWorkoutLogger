# Workout Logger Application 
This project is a workout logging application designed to help users easily track and analyze their gym routines. The application will allow users to log their workouts, including exercises, sets, reps, and weights used. Additionally, users will be able to track their strength progress over time and identify trends in their performance. 

# Who Is This Application For
The app is tailored for **anyone** who enjoys working out—whether they’re seasoned gym-goers or beginners looking to stay organized and improve their routines.

# Why I Chose This Project

I chose this project because I frequent the gym myself, but I've often found it difficult to stay consistent with logging my workouts. I believe this application will not only help me improve my own performance but also provide value to others who want to stay on top of their fitness goals. By offering detailed insights and feedback, the app will encourage users to push themselves to do better than their last workout, which will endorse continuous progress and motivation.
